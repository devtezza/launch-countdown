## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### Useful resources

- [CSS Filter Generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This tool calculates the correct values of CSS filter property functions to generate a desired color. It helped me to change the color of svg icons on hover state.
- [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - It saved a lot of time by generating browser prefixes.
- [flip-clock](https://github.com/1isten/flip-clock) - This repository helped me to get a hint on how to create animated flip cards and how to add a countdown to it. I just adapted the code to fit my needs on this challenge.
